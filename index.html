    <h1 style="font-size:160%;"> This game represents how we enter different stages in life.
       As the player, you start the game as a new shape and color each time.
       You also gain points for hitting the smaller balls, as they are
      different objectives and goals to achieve. Merging too far
 from your goals and from your life causes you to lose the game.  </h1>
